technical conference gathering users and developers working on and with
4.4BSD based operating systems family and related projects.

EuroBSDcon gives the exceptional opportunity to learn about latest news
from the BSD world, witness contemporary deployment case studies, and
meet personally other users and companies using BSD oriented
technologies. EuroBSDcon is also a boiler plate for ideas, discussions
and information exchange, which often turn into programming projects.

The conference has always attracted active programmers, administrators
and aspiring students, as well as IT companies at large, which found the
conference a convenient and quality training option for its staff. We
firmly believe that high profile education is vital to the future of
technology, and hence greatly welcome students and young people to this
