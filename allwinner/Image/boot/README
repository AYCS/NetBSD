Framebuffer console
 
To use HDMI for the console device, add console=fb to bootargs in uEnv.txt.
 
If the connected display does not let you disable overscan, you can add a margin
 to the framebuffer by with the fb.margin bootargs option. For example, to set a
 25-pixel margin around the screen, add fb.margin=25 to uEnv.txt
